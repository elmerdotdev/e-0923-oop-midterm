# OOP - Midterm Project

Goal: Create a CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) web application using classes

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Design and build a responsive website where you can add, find, edit, and delete data using one or more classes
3. Make sure to create different methods for each functionality. For example, one method for add, find, edit, and delete
4. Push your changes to your master branch
5. Present your midterm project

## Guidelines

- You are free to choose any idea for the site as long as you can implement CRUD
- You can use an API to pull the initial data but you need to store that data into an array inside your constructor
